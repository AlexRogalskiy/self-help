## üå© Installation

    npm install --global self-help

## üïπ Usage

### Interactive CLI

Navigate a Self-Help Document from the Command Line:

    self-help interactive --source ./path/to/help-document.js

#### Example

![screenshot](/static/self-help.gif)

### Generate Markdown

Generate Markdown from a Self-Help Document:

    self-help markdown --source ./path/to/help-document.js

Markdown is written to [stdout](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/stdout.htm) for you to pipe into other Command Line Programs or write to a file.

#### Example

The `self-help` RxJS Operator Decision Tree Example [exported as Markdown](https://github.com/JamieMason/self-help/wiki/RxJS-Operator-Decision-Tree).

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Writing Documents

A **Help Document** is a JavaScript Module exporting a `getHelpDocument` method of type `GetHelpDocument`.

```ts
type GetHelpDocument = () => Node | Promise<Node>;
```

It returns a Nested Hierarchy of **Node** Objects.

```ts
type Node = Leaf | Branch | AsyncBranch;
```

Which form the **Decision Tree** a User will navigate.

```ts
export const getHelpDocument = (): Node => ({
  label: "Welcome to Milk and Cookies, how can we help?",
  children: [
    {
      label: `I'm Thirsty, and`,
      children: () => http.get("/milks-walkthrough.json")
    },
    {
      label: `I'm Hungry, and`,
      children: [
        {
          label: "I love Cookies, so",
          children: () => http.get("/cookies-walkthrough.json")
        },
        {
          label: `Cookies aren't my thing`,
          value: fs.readFileSync("/GET-OUT.md", "utf8")
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

### `Node` Types

#### `Branch`

A `Branch` presents multiple options to choose from in the form of its `children` Array. Children can be a combination of other `Branch`, `AsyncBranch` or `Leaf` Nodes.

```js
{
  label: 'I just cloned the project, and',
  children: [...]
}
```

#### `AsyncBranch`

An `AsyncBranch` is the same as a `Branch` except its `children` property is a Function which returns a Promise.

This mechanism allows Help Documents to be combined and linked together, use it to **compose higher-level guides which pull together other Help Documents hosted online** or **break down a large Help Document into smaller files** that can be lazily-loaded at runtime.

```js
{
  label: 'I just cloned the project, and',
  children: () => Promise.resolve([])
}
```

#### `Leaf`

A **Leaf** represents the answer the User has been looking for as they have been navigating a given Help Document. The value can be any String, but is **normally the contents of a Markdown Document** which explains the answer to the User.

```js
{
  label: 'I want to install dependencies',
  value: fs.readFileSync('/installation.md', 'utf8')
}
```
